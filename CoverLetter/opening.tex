I have long followed \companyName's work in \textbf{\companyMission}.
While my recent focus on QA and system validation aligns most closely with the \textbf{Continuous Improvement} side of this role, my background in mechatronics makes me equally driven to contribute to \textbf{Product Design}.

I thrive in environments where engineering isn't just theoretical; I am at my best when \textbf{\targetPainPoint}. I am eager to bring my hybrid hardware and software experience to a product that directly improves lives.
